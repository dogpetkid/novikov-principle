A project created as a result of a mechanical concept for I wanted to test within a game.
This mechanic is the concept of having a clone that kills you on contact but follows all of your moves similar to ones from [Super Mario Galaxy clones](https://youtu.be/cjvR99fAdJM?t=28). Difference being the ability to warp back to it and replace it before a new one spawns, thus allowing for a "space and time" travel.
